System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Users\pchen\source\repos\TestProject\TestProject\bin\Debug\TestApiCore.dll' or one of its dependencies. Operation is not supported. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131515); File name: 'file:///C:\Users\pchen\source\repos\TestProject\TestProject\bin\Debug\TestApiCore.dll' ---> System.NotSupportedException: An attempt was made to load an assembly from a network location which would have caused the assembly to be sandboxed in previous versions of the .NET Framework. This release of the .NET Framework does not enable CAS policy by default, so this load may be dangerous.
